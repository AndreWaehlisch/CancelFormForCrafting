This very lightweight addon removes your shapeshift form when you try to craft something.

When you try to craft and are shapeshifted you would only get the error message "You are in shapeshift form" normally [Edit: This seems to be a bug which comes along with Quartz]. The addon removes your shapeshift and lets you craft your stuff. It is enabled for druids only.

The addon is disabled while you are in combat, so it should not cause any taint.

Just be cautious when trying to craft something while you are in flight form and in mid-air :-)
